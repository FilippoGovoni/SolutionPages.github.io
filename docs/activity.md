<h2>Activity status</h2>
Updated: 13/02/2019 <br>
The status of the activity provides immediate information on the progress of the activity, if it is planned, if it is still editable, if it has been approved or invoiced.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Status Planned</h2>
The Planned status is automatically managed by Fastservice, it can not be selected by the user. The task status is set to Planned, if the user enters an activity with a future date with respect to the current day of insertion.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Status Performed</h2>
The Performed status is automatically managed by Fastservice, it can not be selected by the user. The activity is automatically set by Fastservice in the Performed state when it is saved.

Note: an activity in the Performed state remains modifiable by the user who entered it.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Status Approved</h2>
The Approved status is managed by users.

Some organizations, the activities performed, are further verified by other departments, to be validated and possibly accounted for. In this case, users with an administrator role (Admin role) or an operation manager (OUManager role), proceed to control the activity and, if valid, pass it "manually" in Approved status.

An activity in the Approved state can not be changed by users with an agent role, but it can be modified by users with an Admin or OUManager role.

Note: an activity in the Approved state is ready to be processed by other procedures (see export for management, billing, etc.)
</p>
<p>
<h2>Status Recorded</h2>
The Recorded status is automatically managed by Fastservice. The activities can be passed into Recorded status by Fastservice following the execution of other procedures (see export for management, billing, etc.). Activities in the Recorded state can no longer be changed by any role.
